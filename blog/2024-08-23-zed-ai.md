title:  "Crazy new AI features in Zed"

This may be my next go to editor because of the new seamless inline and assistant panel features that Zed is adding. I can see that they are gearing this up to be a subscription based thing unfortunately... But I will enjoy it for now.

I have been pretty skeptical of AI mostly because so much of it is gimmicky and generally slows me down, but this seems to be a pretty good use of it.

I wanted to write a quick summary of all the cool new commands in the latest release, but then I realized why should I do this when Claude is much faster (and maybe even better). I used the new `/fetch` Zed command to give context to the blog post and here is what it responded with.

My exact prompt:

```
/fetch https://zed.dev/blog/zed-ai
give a summary of the blog post and be sure to outline each of slash commands and what they do. Make it succinct and easy to understand in the fewest sentences
```

Claude 3.5 Sonnet Response:

> This blog post introduces Zed AI, a new AI-assisted coding feature integrated into the Zed text editor, developed in collaboration with Anthropic. Key features include:
>
> 1. An assistant panel for interacting with AI models using slash commands:
    - `/tab`: Insert open tab contents
    - `/file`: Insert specific file or directory contents
    - `/terminal`: Include terminal output
    - `/diagnostics`: Insert codebase diagnostic information
    - `/fetch`: Insert response from an HTTP URL
    - `/workflow`: Create guided, multi-step code transformations (in development)
>
> 2. Inline transformations for code generation and modification using natural language prompts.
>
> 3. Transparent and editable AI interactions, allowing users to see and control all context provided to the model.
>
> 4. Upcoming features include `/project` for quick context insertion and `/auto` for automatic context gathering.
>
> The post emphasizes Zed AI's focus on transparency, control, and extensibility, inviting users to try the service and contribute to its development.

Incredible stuff.
